Some questions to consider:

Does your code build properly with "stack build"?

The code succesfully builds with "stack build" on my machine.

Are there any parts of the specification you did not implement in part
A?

I implemented all of part A, it succesfully prints the numbers in command line after using "Stack Run"

For the 'stretch' part B, which libraries did you use and what kind of
output did you generate?

I used haskell chart to create a pie chart. I used the libraries "Graphics.Rendering.Chart.Backend.Cairo" and "Graphics.Rendering.Chart.Easy".
